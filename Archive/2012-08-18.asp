							<h1 class="articleTitle">8/18 Preseason Game at the Union Pub, 8:00 PM</h1>
							<p>Please join fellow DC Chicago Bears fans for the following preseason game at the Union Pub:</p>
							<p>Chicago Bears v. Washington Redskins<br />
							Saturday, August 18, 8 PM</p>
							<p>The Union Pub (UP) has been DC's gathering point for the area's Chicago Bears fans over the past six seasons.</p>
							<p>DC Chicago Bears fans are spread throughout the bar. Typically some sit in the side room, others in bar area towards the back or on the patio. It is a great place to meet many Bears fans in the DMV area and The UP has consistently treated us to only the finest PBR and Goose Island beer and food specials, the Bears fight song, and, most importantly, the shrine to Ditka.</p>
