							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The two teams have met each other 197 times (including 2 postseason games), with the Chicago Bears winning 94 games and the Green Bay Packers winning 97 games. They have also tied 6 times. </p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favored</a> by 6 pts against the Packers </strong></p>
							<p><strong>Playoff Clincher:</strong> "A win over the Packers (5-7-1) would clinch the North for the Bears (9-4). So would a loss by Minnesota to Miami. And ties by both the Bears and the Vikings would do the trick, too. Even if they don't clinch the division, they could still secure a playoff spot on Sunday. In that case, a tie against Green Bay&mdash;or a tie or loss by Washington against Jacksonville" (<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/12/13/bears-sweet-scenario-clinch-north-beat-packers-to-do-it/38732371/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>USA Today</em></a>, 12/13)</p>
