							<p><strong>Karma:</strong> "Aaron Rodgers was sacked 20 times in 11 games against the Bears under Smith with nary a scratch on him. In the NFC Championship Game in 2011, Rodgers tripped up Brian Urlacher to thwart a potentially game-turning interception return. Yet when Cutler simply ran downfield to stop an interception return against the Chargers the next season, he suffered a broken thumb that ended his season and the Bears’ postseason hopes" (11/7, Potash, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/23605996-606/is-trestman-throwing-jay-cutler-to-the-lions.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in a new window">Sun-Times</a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Don't Taser Me, Honey:</strong> "The case unfolded in Mayville, Wis., where John Grant and his wife, Nicole Grant, stopped at a bar to watch the Monday Night Football broadcast. Nicole, a Green Bay fan, bet her husband that he could shoot her with the electronic weapon for three seconds if his Bears beat the Packers" (11/7, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/chicago-bears-fan-arraigned-for-tasering-wife-after-green-bay-loss" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in a new window">Examiner.com</a>).</p>
