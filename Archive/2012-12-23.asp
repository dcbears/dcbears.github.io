							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">5.5pts favorites</a> against Cardinals Underdogs</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Perception is Reality: </strong> "If the Bears win their last two games — at the Cardinals and at the Lions — they will have a 10-6 record. Does this look or feel anything like a 10-6 team? Bill Parcells used to say you are what your record says who you are. Had he watched these Bears with any regularity, though, he would have claimed he was misquoted" (Morrissey, 12/16, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/17054689-606/morrissey-sixth-straight-loss-to-packers-signals-its-time-for-change.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Sun-Times</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong> "The Bears have run a play that has gone backward 11 percent of the time. Only two teams have had more plays for negative yardage. And that's not including penalties. The Bears offense has been penalized 52 times, fifth most in the NFL" (Pompei, 12/20, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-1221-bears-pompei-chicago--20121221,0,2744300.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</strong></p>
