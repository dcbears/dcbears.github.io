							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">3pt</a> favorites</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Tweet Fail:</strong> "Whoever was behind the keyboard that runs the Twitter account for Cleatus, the animated robot that pops up on FOX's broadcasts, unleashed this zinger at the angry Bears fans: <em>I understand <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Bears" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">#Bears</a> fan are upset the game was switched but it could be worse, it could be last week and you could be down 32-7!</em>" (Bhasin, 11/25,  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fox-tweet-bears-fans-2012-11?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+businessinsider+%28Business+Insider%29" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Business Insider</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>The Cutler Paradox:</strong> "On the present roster, Cutler obviously is the Bears' most valuable player. Since the start of the 2010 season, the Bears are 26-8 in games he finishes and 2-9 in games in which he does not. But therein lies the problem: Cutler has missed all or parts of 11 games in the last three seasons, including the biggest one of all — the NFC Championship Game in 2011. He's missed all or part of two of the three biggest games this season — losses to the Texans and 49ers. In the one big game he played, he threw four interceptions and had a 28.2 passer rating in a 23-10 loss to the Packers at Lambeau Field" (11/27, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/16663923-419/jay-cutler-not-best-but-best-of-rest.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan on Da Bears:</strong> "If we just had a star at the slot receiver position or at tight end, I think we be better off. If we had a Victor Cruz or Wes Welker. I think right now that's our Achilles' heel" (Lenker, 11/28, <a href="http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2012/11/smashing_pumpkins_corgan_cover.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>MassLive</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong>   "Marshall's 12-catch, 92-yard game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday was also a unique stat line that is rarely seen in the league. Marshall became the 35th player since 1966 (start of the Super Bowl era) to catch 12 or more passes in a game and finish with fewer than 100 yards receiving in the game... It was also only the ninth time in those 35 instances that a player's team won in a game where a player had 12-plus receptions and fewer than 100 receiving yards" (Tapp, 11/27, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1423884-brandon-marshalls-unique-stat-line-from-chicago-bears-win-over-vikings" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Bleacher Report</em></a>).</p>
