							<p><strong>Cutler & Adversity: </strong> "Jay Cutler, on the other hand, has done an about-face from a public relations standpoint. He handled his turbulent offseason in typical Cutler fashion. He shrugged. Unflappable. I like that" (McNeil, 11/17, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-1118-dan-mcneil--20111118,0,1332490.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>

							<p><strong>The Great Brian Urlacher: </strong>"At 33 in his 12th season, Urlacher leads NFL linebackers in interceptions (three) and the Bears in tackles for a loss (five). He has forced two fumbles and returned one for a touchdown . . . If Urlacher keeps performing at a high level and the Bears keep winning, he will receive consideration for his second NFL defensive player of the year award (Haugh, 11/16, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1117-haugh-bears-chicago--20111117,0,4263048.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
