							<p><strong>Ouch:</strong> Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford suffered injuries against the Bears in each of his first two seasons — a knee injury thanks to Adewale Ogunleye in 2009 and a separated right shoulder on a hit by Julius Peppers last season (Biggs, 10/9, <em><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1010-4-downs-bears-lions-preview-chicago--20111010,0,7500185.story" title="External site opens in new window" class="external" target="_blank" >Tribune</a></em>).</p>
							<p><strong>Underpaid at $550k: </strong> In an offense that's looked about as fierce as the Berenstain Bears, running back Matt Forte has played like a killer grizzly hungry for … well, a new contract. Considering he's a potential MVP candidate making $550,000 this season, the kind of money Jay Cutler probably has between his couch cushions, it's hard to blame Forte for seeking a raise (Smith, 10/9, <a href="http://www.redeyechicago.com/sports/ct-red-1010-smithcolumn-20111009,0,3504371.story" title="External site opens in new window" class="external" target="_blank" ><em>RedEye</em></a>).</p>
