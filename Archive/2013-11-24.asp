							<p><strong>On Cutler:</strong> "Cutler is a polarizing player. He can single-handedly lose a game, and then come out and throw 5 TDs on five perfectly thrown balls the next week. He was always question mark as a $100 million quarterback because his flaws were much more obvious than those of his peers. The fact that McCown is succeeding in his absence will at least give the Bears some hesitation, and that hesitation could be costly" (11/21, Manfred,  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bears-back-qb-josh-165833597.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in a new window">YahooFinance</a>)</p>
