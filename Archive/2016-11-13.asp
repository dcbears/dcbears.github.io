							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favored</a> by 2.5 points</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears lead the all-time series with the Buccaneers 38-18 and have won three straight. They won the last meeting 26-21 last Dec. 27 in Tampa.</p>
							<p><strong>Cutler on Trump:</strong>  "I'm happy with the results," Cutler said in a news conference. "I've supported Trump for a while. I'm not going to dive into it. I know it's a sensitive issue, but I like where it's going." (<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/bears/2016/11/10/jay-cutler-donald-trump-election-chicago/93603466/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">USA Today</a>, 11/10)</p>
							<p><strong>Eternal Optimism:</strong> The return of starters like Cutler and outside linebacker Pernell McPhee have proven to be a big boost for the Bears in recent weeks, but it is still up to Chicago to actually put wins on the board. The second half sets up favorably for the Bears, but they will need to focus on the task ahead for the week instead of looking at the broader scope of the division (Eurich, 11/11, <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/positivity-will-only-take-bears-so-far-in-2016/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>CBSSports</em></a>)</p>
