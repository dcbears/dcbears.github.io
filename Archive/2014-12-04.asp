							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 3.5 point <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Cowboys</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> "Tucker will likely be the fall guy for Chicago's struggles, as Trestman gets at least another year to lead the team with the possibility of a healthier and improved defense. The problem, then, will be trying to find a new defensive coordinator willing to come onto the staff with the head coach possibly starting the following season on the hot seat. It could be a coach who just needs one year of recuperation as a coordinator, or a coach looking for a short coordinator stint as a launching pad for a head coaching job" (Pizzuta, 12/2, <a href="http://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/3831/why-marc-trestman-deserves-another-year-with-the-chicago-bears" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>numberFire.com</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, damn lies and statistics: </strong> "The Bears haven't allowed a 100-yard rusher all season, and if that surprises you, it should &mdash; they gave up 2,583 rushing yards last year, the most in the history of the franchise.The list of running backs they've shut down this season, though, is a veritable who's-that: not a single rusher currently ranked in the top 12 in yards per game has been on their schedule thus far" (Finley, 12/2, <a href="http://chicagosuntimes.com/sports/bears-improved-rush-defense-gets-a-test-cowboys-star-demarco-murray/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
