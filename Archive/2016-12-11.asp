							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 9pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a></strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears lead the all-time series with the Lions 97-71-5. Before their 17-14 win in October, they had lost six straight games to Detroit for the first time since 1968-70.</p>
							<p><strong>RIP Rashaan Salaam:</strong> Former Heisman trophy winner and Bears first-round running back Rashaan Salaam was found dead in Boulder, Colorado on Monday night. Salaam, who won the Heisman after setting the University of Colorado rushing record as a junior 1994 with 2,055 yards, was selected No. 21 overall by the Bears in 1995. He rushed for 1,074 yards in addition to 10 touchdowns as a rookie, but would play just two more seasons in Chicago prior to being released (12/6, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000752658/article/former-bears-running-back-rashaan-salaam-dies-at-42" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"> <em>NFL.com</em></a></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong>  "In regards to pure statistics, the Bears' offense has taken a significant step back. They score almost 4 points fewer per game than last year (20.9ppg to 17ppg). The offense has also struggled with taking care of the ball. The Bears suffered 21 total turnovers last season. With 4 games to go before the season is over, the Bears are already at 17" (Ingalls, 12/7, <a href="http://beargoggleson.com/2016/12/07/three-reasons-why-the-chicago-bears-need-to-fire-john-fox/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>BearGogglesOn.com</em></a>)</p>
