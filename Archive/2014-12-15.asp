							<p><strong>Don't bet on it:</strong>  "The cost of ushering out the coaching staff, however, would come at a fraction of what it would cost to move on from Cutler, who has won one playoff game in six seasons with the Bears and has had countless decisions within the building centered around him. The bill for starting over with new coaches and a new plan at quarterback would be huge &mdash; more than $25 million" (Biggs, 12/14, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-bear-essentials-spt-1215-20141214-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</p>
