							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 3pt <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favorites</a> against the 49ers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears trail the all-time series with the 49ers 33-31-1. The Bears won the last meeting 26-6 on Dec. 4, 2016 at Soldier Field</p>
							<p><strong>On Trubisky:</strong> "Nobody should give up on Trubisky this early, but everyone can expect more now. Some context might help calm the masses. Through seven starts, Trubisky has completed only 52.8 of his passes for 1,135 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions for a passer rating of 70.8. Through seven starts as a rookie, Rams quarterback Jared Goff, the No. 1 pick of the 2016 draft, had posted similarly unimpressive statistics: A 54.6 completion percentage with 1,089 yards with five touchdowns and seven interceptions for a passer rating of 63.6" (Haugh, 11/30, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-bears-haugh-mitch-trubisky-must-improve-20171130-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a></p>
