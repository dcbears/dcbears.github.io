							<p><strong>It's Always Sunny in Chicago:</strong>  "Lovie Smith said the Bears are in "great shape" and made no apologies about his team's 8-5 record after four losses in the last five games, including a home meltdown in the final four minutes and overtime against the Seahawks" (Biggs, 12/12, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1213-bears-lovie-smith-chicago--20121213,0,7211992.story" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Brandon Marshall on the Packers:</strong>  "I'm not going to use the word hate, but I really dislike the Green Bay Packers and their players" (Jahns, 12/12, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/16973438-606/bears-wideout-brandon-marshall-all-but-hates-the-green-bay-packers.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Fire Lovie!:</strong> What could a 10th season of Smith possibly tell us that the previous nine haven't made abundantly clear? While we're at it, what could the last three regular-season games of 2012 tell us that the previous nine years haven't already answered? He can't win a Super Bowl (Morrissey, 12/12, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/16977406-419/morrissey-nein-more-years-for-bears-coach-lovie-smith.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</strong></p>	
							<p><strong>Bench Kellen Davis:</strong>  "I find it hard to believe that the Chicago Bears coaching staff still believes that their best option at tight end is Kellen Davis. What ever pluses he may hold over his backups are no where near able to make up for his minuses. Kellen Davis has been comically bad in 2012, and the punch line could be, 'Chicago Bears miss the playoffs'" (Wiltfong, 12/11, <a href="http://www.windycitygridiron.com/2012/12/11/3751942/the-chicago-bears-need-to-bench-kellen-davis-now" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Windy City Gridiron</em></a>)</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong> "Over the past two seasons, they're 8-1 in games in which their defense gets into the end zone and 8-12 when their defense doesn't score. That's a pretty amazing stat that shows how dependent the Bears have been on their defense not only stopping opponents but scoring TDs" (Mayer, 12/10, <a href="http://www.chicagobears.com/news/chalk-talk/article-1/Whats-Bears-record-when-defense-doesnt-score/469cbc87-d6bd-44d3-9935-5537b5d47ab8" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Chicago Bears</em></a>).</p>
