							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 4.5 point <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Detroit</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Turkey will be served:</strong> The Union Pub will have roasted turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, stuffing and pumpkin pie on hand for the game</p>
							<p><strong>On Detroit:</strong>  "They're the Bears of Detroit, with a history of disappointment and second-half failures that will hang over them like an ominous dark cloud until they clinch a playoff berth. The Lions have made the playoffs once in the last 14 seasons. They haven't won a playoff game since 1991. They haven't won an NFL championship since the Eisenhower administration" (Potash, 11/24, <a href="http://chicagosuntimes.com/sports/10-observations-lions-history-of-struggle-offers-bears-hope/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, damn lies and statistics: </strong>  "The main number you know about the Bears and the first quarter is zero &mdash; the amount of points they have scored in that first quarter over the past six games. The streak matches one in 2002, and the Bears went 4-12 that season" (11/24, <a href="http://www.chicagofootball.com/2014/11/24/chicago-bears-first-quarter-struggles-by-the-numbers/bonz02s/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>ChicagoFootball.com</em></a>)</p>
