							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<!--<p><strong>Bears are 7pt <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">underdogs</a> against 49ers </strong></p>-->
							<p><strong>The season in perspective: </strong>   "The Bears are now 0-3 against teams that will surely be in the postseason, a troubling sign for a city and squad that really believes a Super Bowl is possible. Maybe it still is. It all depends on Cutler and the offensive improvement, starting first and foremost with baby steps for the line. It doesn't matter who is playing quarterback if the opposing pass rush is going to be so dominant, and it shouldn't take a good book to tell you that" (O'Donnell, 11/20, <a href="http://chicago.sbnation.com/chicago-bears/2012/11/20/3670922/san-francisco-49ers-chicago-bears-cutler-injury-colin-kaepernick" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">SBNation</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Offensive woes: </strong> "After 10 games, the offense really has no ideas or identity. Quarterback Jay Cutler made a valid point Tuesday when he told his WMVP-AM 1000 audience that losses don't necessarily force NFL offenses to reinvent who they are. But before anything can be reinvented, it first must be invented — and the Bears offense under coordinator Mike Tice has yet to be worthy of a patent" (Haugh, 11/21, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-1121-haugh-bears-chicago--20121121,0,4981712.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong>  "The following statistic should be a trivial oddity. With the Bears, it’s speaking louder each week: On their first pass attempt in 10 games this season, they have four sacks for 42 yards in losses, a fumble, an interception, two other incompletions, a two-yard reception (followed by a sack) and an 11-yard scramble by Cutler (followed by a sack)" (Potash, 11/20, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/16525653-419/not-our-night-doesnt-explain-bears-frightening-problems.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
