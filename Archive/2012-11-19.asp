							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 7pt <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">underdogs</a> against 49ers </strong></p>
							<p><strong>On Cutler:</strong>  "The idea that Cutler is close to becoming an elite quarterback is getting fuzzier all the time. His loyalists say he’s 12-2 in his last 14 starts. Swell. Kyle Orton was 10-5 as a rookie starter with the Bears in 2005. Rex Grossman was 13-3 the following season. Wins and losses do not make an elite quarterback" (Morrissey, 11/13, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/16359368-606/jay-cutler-bears-offense-are-both-still-in-a-fog.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>On Campbell:</strong> "I've heard it suggested that Jason Campbell is the best backup quarterback in this year's NFL — and that maybe the former Raider and Redskin is better than any No. 2 the Bears have ever had. That's tantamount to the proclamation that Jay Cutler is the best starter in Bears history. One need not squint to see how low the bar previously was set" (McNeil, 11/16, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-1116-dan-mcneil--20121116,0,6645504.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</strong></p>

							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong>  "Of the top 10 teams in the NFC, the Bears have statistically the second-hardest schedule behind the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears have just two games versus teams below .500 (at Arizona and at Detroit)" (Dallke, 11/14, <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1409651-chicago-bears-control-their-playoff-destiny-despite-ugly-loss-to-houston" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Bleacher Report</em></a>).</p>
