							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favored</a> by 6 points</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, damn lies and statistics: </strong> "In their last five games, the Bears have been outscored, 41-0, in the first quarter. It gets worse: they've committed 12 penalties for 86 yards in the first quarters of those five games. In the other three quarters combined? Twenty for 240 yards." (Finley, 11/21, <a href="http://chicagosuntimes.com/sports/ten-question-marks-for-the-bears-as-they-prepare-for-the-bucs/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>In summary:</strong> "The Bears aren't as bad as they were against New England and Green Bay but they are good enough to take care of a bad Tampa squad and give the suddenly-sliding Lions a game on Thanksgiving. This season is far from over and while Sunday's game doesn't have some kind of larger "They need to beat Lovie to show they made the right choice" they do need to beat Lovie's Bucs simply because they are a better team" (Householder, 11/21, <a href="http://www.windycitygridiron.com/2014/11/21/7259465/chicago-bears-must-beat-lovie-smith-tampa-bay-buccaneers-sunday" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Windy City Gridiron</em></a>)</p>
