							<p><strong>Bears are 8pt <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Underdogs</a></strong></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong> Da Bears have won four of their last five games coming off an open date under Lovie Smith and are 14-8 all-time in the regular season since off weeks were introduced in 1990. Only four franchises have better records (Biggs, 11/6, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1107-four-downs-bears-eagles-preview-chicag-20111107,0,1513391.story" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Playoffs?: </strong>If the playoffs started today, the Bears (4-3) would be the No. 2 wild-card team in the NFC — the same spot the Packers parlayed into the Vince Lombardi Trophy last season (Potash, 10/31, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/8536409-606/bears-road-to-10-6.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Sun-Times</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Jay Cutler & Chinese Currency Manipulation: </strong> "The data is unequivocally clear that as goes backup quarterback Caleb Hanie’s relative number of pass attempts, so goes the relative strength of the Chinese yuan compared to the U.S. dollar. This is precisely what the U.S. and world economy needs: higher demand for imports from countries that aren’t China and a quarterback who can operate in Mike Martz’s pass-heavy, high-stakes offense" (<a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/curb-chinese-currency-manipulation-by-benching-jay-cutler" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">McSweeneys.net</a>).</p>
