							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 9pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Green Bay</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The 193rd meeting. Da Bears lead the all-time series, 94-92-1.</p>
							<p><strong>Chicago's Other Lovable Losers:</strong>  "Since the 1963 championship, the Chicago Bears own a 389-409-4 record. They have been a losing franchise for over 50 years, and that record includes the 90-37 record the team amassed from 1984 to 1991. Not including those seasons, the Bears are almost 70 games below .500 since 1963. Translation? The Chicago Bears have become a losing franchise. You know what losing franchises do best? They lose" (Zimmerman, 10/17, <a href="http://beargoggleson.com/2016/10/17/chicago-bears-nothing-losing-franchise/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>BearGogglesOn.com</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong> 64 (?!?) Consecutive games that Bears opponents scored first-half points until the Week 6 game versus the Jaguars, when the Bears shut Jacksonville out in the game's opening 30 minutes. It was the first first-half shutout by Chicago since Oct. 22, 2012 versus Detroit (Kaberon, 10/18, <a href="http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-bythenumbers/By-the-Numbers-Bears-at-Packers/c5629d27-5f65-43c0-b21f-7f5af1541dec" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>ChicagoBears.com</em></a>)</p>
