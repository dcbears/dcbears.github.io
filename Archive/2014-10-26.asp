							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 6pt <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Pats</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Believe?:</strong> "The Bears aren't playing the us-against-the-world card this week, possibly because they can understand why the world would be against them. Though they might believe in themselves, it's as if they grasp why public faith in them is so low. They know they have done nothing to make fans believe" (Morrisey, 10/22, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/30591895-419/bears-24-patriots-21-wait-what.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, damn lies and statistics:</strong>   "If merely a winning record makes for an elite quarterback, the league seemed to be teeming with them at the start of the season. Coming into this season, 25 active quarterbacks possessed winning records as starters. Currently, players such as former Bears quarterback Rex Grossman (.532), Mark Sanchez(.532), Michael Vick (.547) and Alex Smith (.550) win at a higher clip as starters than Cutler, yet none are cashing in at his level" (Wright, 10/23, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/" title="External site opens in new window" class="external" target="_blank">ESPN</a>)</p>
