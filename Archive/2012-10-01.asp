							<p><strong>Fix It!:  </strong> "When you crunch the numbers, if the NFL gave the locked-out referees everything they wanted, it would cost about $100,000 extra per team per season. That equals about four games' pay for one of a team's lowest-paid players. The owners are watching their sport burn because they won't improve the officials' compensation by about one-fourth the amount they would pay a backup guard? Think about that" (Plaschke, 9/24,<a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/football/nfl/la-sp-0925-plaschke-nfl-officials-20120925-28,0,1808277.column?page=1&sc=4527510115239610072" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>LA Times</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Reason to be Optimistic: </strong> "If history holds true, the Bears will be able to make significant progress in the coming weeks. The Bears had three offensive clunkers in the first half of the 2010 regular season (New York Giants, Seattle Seahawks, Washington Redskins) before righting the ship and reeling off five straight wins following their bye week. Last year, the Bears had difficulty moving the ball against New Orleans, Green Bay and Detroit before embarking on a similar five-game winning streak until Cutler broke his thumb against the San Diego Chargers on Nov. 20" (Dickerson, 9/24, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4678446/bears-offense-following-familiar-path-early" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>ESPNChicago</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Israel Idonije's Restaurant Fails: </strong> Alain's, a new restaurant at the corner of 14th and South Michigan and co-owned by Israel Idonije of the Chicago Bears, was served and eviction notice on Monday . . . The restaurant is less than two months old" (9/25, <a href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/grizzly-detail/Israel-Idonije-Restaurant-Gets-Sacked-171186601.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>NBCChicago</em></a>).</p>						</div>
