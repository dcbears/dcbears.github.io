							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 5.5pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against the Texans</strong></p>
							<p><strong>The Union Pub will be serving Old Style this season</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong>The Texans are the only current NFL team the Bears have never defeated. Houston is 3-0 in the series, recording wins by scores of 24-5 in 2004, 31-24 in 2008 and 13-6 in 2012.</p>
							<p><strong>According to Hub: </strong>  "I think the Bears right now are a better football team than they were at the end of last season, a 6-10 season against what for now looks like it was a tougher slate. They are better principally because they are dramatically improved in the front seven on defense with the arrivals of Trevathan, Freeman and Hicks, good health and year's experience as outside 3-4 linebackers for Willie Young and Lamarr Houston and because I really think Eddie Goldman can be a Pro Bowler as he continues to grow and mature. But that doesn't guarantee they'll win more than six" (Arkush, 9/7,  <a href="http://www.profootballweekly.com/2016/09/08/hub-arkush-chicago-bears-better-than-last-year-hard-to-say/aix2kqu/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Pro Football Weekly</em></a>)</p>
							<p><b>Terrible Idea:</b> "The Bears would be open to issuing naming rights to Soldier Field in theory, chairman George McCaskey said, though there's no reason to think it would happen anytime soon" (Finley, 9/7, <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/bears-open-to-naming-rights-for-soldier-field-in-theory/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
