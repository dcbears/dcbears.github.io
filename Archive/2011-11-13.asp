							<p><strong>Big Game:</strong> If the Bears want to be the fifth seed in the NFC, as opposed to the sixth, a victory over the Lions is of utmost importance. It's unlikely the Bears can win the NFC North, not with Aaron Rodgers and the Packers firing on all cylinders as the league's only unbeaten team (Mulligan, 11/9, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1109-mulligan-bears-nfl-chicago--20111109,0,2723316.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong>  Cutler wasn’t sacked against the Eagles last week, ending a streak of 29 regular-season games that he’d been sacked at least once. </p>
							<p><strong>Will Gault Robbed: </strong>" ...more than $100,000 in jewelry is missing from the home -- and Gault's rep tells us one of the missing items is Gault's prized '85 Super Bowl ring ... which famously boasts 40 diamonds, including a half-carat diamond in the center surrounded by 13 smaller diamonds" (11/11, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/11/willie-gault-super-bowl-ring-stolen/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">TMZ</a>).</p>
