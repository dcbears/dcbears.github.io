							<p>The Union Pub will serve Old Style for games. As many natives of Chicago know, Old Style is extremely difficult to find anywhere near the DC area. The Union Pub's commitment to DC area Chicago Bears fans led them to recently send an employee to Chicago and buy large quantities of the beer. Our sources tell us the purchase was so large Wrigley Field had to place an extra order of the beverage so they could continue to serve the Friendly Confines this season. </p>
							<p>The Union Pub has hosted DC Chicago Bears Fans since 2006.</p>
