							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 14.5pt <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Packers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Messaging: </strong> "The Bears insist they aren't rebuilding, but they might want to start using the "R" word out loud. That would at least give fans hope that something is being done. It's how Cubs fans found life worth living during that three-year stretch in which the team finished a combined 90 games under .500" (Morrisey, 9/23, <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/983909/tanks-lot-bears-shooting-next-years-top-draft-choice" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Series History: </strong> Seattle and Chicago have met 14 times before in the regular season, and the Seahawks hold an edge in the regular-season series with a 10-4 record. The Bears are 2-0 against Seattle in the playoffs.</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong> "Two games, no sacks. Only the Bears and Raiders claim such an indignity. That's even more alarming when you consider the Bears have more than 20 percent of their team salary cap total allocated to Jared Allen, Pernell McPhee, Lamarr Houston and Willie Young. Of course, all of them except McPhee were signed to play end in a 4-3, but when big-money players don't produce in an NFL salary system designed to create parity, losses pile up" (Campbell, 9/22, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-bears-cardinals-defense-clausen-forte-20150922-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</p>
