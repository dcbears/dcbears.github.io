							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 2.5 point <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Packers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Reason to be Optimistic: </strong> "That said, the Bears are already starting to show the effects of new coach and reclamation expert John Fox. Yes, the loss to the Packers was the fourth in a row and 10th in the last 11 games of the NFL's greatest rivalry. But the 31-23 score was a vast improvement from the 55-14 and 38-17 drubbings last season. And unlike under previous coach Marc Trestman, when Chicago often looked flat and unresponsive, these Bears have some feistiness to them" (Armour, 9/14, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/09/14/chicago-bears-matt-forte-jay-cutler-john-fox/72249612/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>USA Today</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Series History: </strong> 92nd regular-season meeting. Bears lead series 58-27-6. The Bears own a 37-11-5 advantage in home games. That doesn't include games played at Wrigley Field from 1930-37 when the Chicago Cardinals were the home team.</p>
