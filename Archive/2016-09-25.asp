							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 8pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Dallas</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> 24th regular-season meeting. Cowboys lead series 12-11. The Bears are 2-0 at AT&T Stadium and have won three of the last four in the series overall, but Dallas won the last meeting 41-28 in 2014 at Soldier Field.</p>
							<p><strong>At least we have the Cubs:</strong>   "The Chicago Bears do have 14 games left, but it seems like their season is already finished. Before Jay Cutler suffered his injury the Bears' offense was playing below-average football. The Bears' running game was virtually nonexistent. The running backs carried the football, with minimal output. Also, the passing game has appeared to have zero continuity" (Shepard, 9/21, <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/3530993/chicago-bears-season-over-after-just-two-games/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Inquisitr</em></a>)</p>
