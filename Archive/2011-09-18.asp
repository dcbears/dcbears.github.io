							<strong>Good things to come?:</strong> &quot;In fact, the only time the Bears have won as convincingly as they did Sunday and failed to have a winning season was in 1996, when the Bears beat the defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys 22-6 on Monday Night Football at Soldier Field&quot; (Potash, 9/12, <a class="external" href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/7615617-419/history-lesson-when-bears-open-well-they-close-well.html" target="_blank">Sun-Times</a>).<br />

							<strong>Getting Paid:</strong> &quot;Robbie Gould put all seven of his kickoffs against the Falcons in the end zone, and five were touchbacks. Soon, he'll trigger an escalator clause in his contract. The clause pays him an extra $62,500 in 2012 for having eight touchbacks in a season. He had a career-high 16 last season and reached the mark in 2008 and 2009&quot; (Biggs, 9/13, <a class="external" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-0913-bears-bits--20110913,0,6940983.story" target="_blank">Tribune</a>).

							<strong>London Tickets:</strong> Jay Cutler, through his foundation, is giving away a pair of tickets to watch the Bears play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in London on Oct. 23. It includes airfare, and accommodations. For more information, visit <a class="external" href="http://jaycutlersix.com/" target="_blank">jaycutlersix.com</a>.
