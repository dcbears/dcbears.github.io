							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 4.5pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against the Colts</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The two teams have met each other 42 times, with the Bears winning 19 games and the Colts winning 23 games.</p>
							<p><strong>On Beating Detroit:</strong>  "Let's be clear; the Detroit Lions are not a good measuring stick. They are a bad football team missing their two best defensive players.  So when we evaluate the Bears' performance on Sunday, their opponent needs to be taken into account. The Bears dominated the game in pretty much every statistical category. They were clearly the better and more talented team, yet they only won by three.  In a nutshell, Sunday's game was the epitome of who the Bears are, talented but wildly inconsistent" (Perper, 10/3, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/bears-backer/2016/10/a-glimpse-in-the-mirror-who-are-these-bears/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>BearsBacker</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Season on the Brink?:</strong>  "The Bears are at a crossroads. Despite the injuries and the issues that this team has faced early on, they are poised to get back on track. However, if they don't do it now, their season is going to go quickly down the toilet. It's not too late for the Bears, but it's now or never. The Bears season is on the line over the next 2 games, how they respond will tell fans everything they need to know" (Zimmerman, 10/5, <a href="http://beargoggleson.com/2016/10/05/chicago-bears-poised-start-winning-streak/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>BearGogglesOn.com</em></a>)</p>
