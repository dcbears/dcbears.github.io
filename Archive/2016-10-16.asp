							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 2.5pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favorites</a> against Jacksonville</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> Chicago leads series, 4-2. Teams have met three times in the last 14 years. Jaguars have lost two of three games at home and in Chicago.</p>
							<p><strong>Well Said:</strong>  "The frustrating thing about where the Bears are right now is it is difficult to discern how they've built off of anything they accomplished last season. I think the fear at this point is they're headed backward from 6-10" (Biggs, 10/12, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/blog/ct-bears-mailbag-jay-cutler-kyle-long-20161012-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong>  "FPI and Football Outsiders each have Chicago's playoff chances at 5 percent or lower, so it might be time to focus on next April. Per FO, the Bears currently have a 17.8 percent chance to pick first overall" (Schatz, 10/12, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/17773282/playoff-odds-predictions-all-32-nfl-teams-2016-nfl-playoffs" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>ESPN</em></a>)</p>
