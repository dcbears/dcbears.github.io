							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">favored</a> by 3.5 pts</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Playoffs?:</strong> "Believe it or not, the Bears still have a chance to make the playoffs even without beating the Packers. At 9-7, they would earn the second wild-card spot if the Lions lost their final three games to finish 8-8. While that might seem unlikely, it’s not impossible the way the Lions are going. They’ve lost three of their last five games and nearly lost to the Vikings at home Sunday." (12/13, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/9407955-606/bears-need-all-the-help-they-can-get.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Chicago Bears on Sam Hurd:</strong> "Making Bears officials unavailable to discuss a player accused of trying to buy 1,000 pounds of marijuana and five to 10 kilograms of cocaine a week only enhanced the perception that the team should have known more about someone who fooled everybody but the feds" (Haugh, 12/15, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1216-haugh-hurd-bears-chicago--20111216,0,1022866.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>).</p>
