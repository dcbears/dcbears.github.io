							<p><strong>Bears are 4pt <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favorites</a> against the Giants</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Enjoy the Moment:</strong> "The Bears are one of the most improved teams in football. They're currently out in front by a game and a half in the NFC North for first place. They have the third-best record overall in the conference. At 8-3, the playoffs are not really the question for the Bears&mdash;but rather, how far can they go" (<a href="http://www.fltimes.com/sports/football/way-we-hear-it-pro-scout-thinks-bears-have-chance/article_cf171ed7-c7c1-5b51-9a69-744880b370b7.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>ProFootballWeekly.com</em></a>, 11/28). </p>

							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong>Chicago leads the league with 104 points off of takeaways&hellip; The Bears are one of just two teams to hold a second-half lead in every game this season, and Chicago leads the league in fewest first-half points allowed (64)&hellip; The Bears are first in the league in three-and-out percentage (.268)&hellip; The Bears are first in the NFL in lowest passer rating allowed (78.3)" (Kaufman, <a href="https://www.chicagobears.com/news/where-bears-team-players-in-the-nfl" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>ChicagoBears.com</em></a>, 11/29)</p>
