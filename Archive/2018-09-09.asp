							<p><strong>Bears are 7.5pt <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Packers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears trail the all-time series against Green Bay with a record of 94-96-6 record in the all-time series. However,  the last three Bears victories against Green Bay were on prime time with two coming on the road at Lambeau.</p>

							<p><strong>On the Season: </strong>"Let's start here, there are 38 players back from last year's 5-11 team that finished last in the NFC North each of the last three seasons. The Bears are vastly improved, but they are still not in the same league talent wise with the Vikings, Eagles, Falcons and Rams, and it remains unclear whether or not they have caught the Saints, Packers and Panthers. Right now the team's improvement is based on projecting performances from individual players who clearly have the tools but have not yet proven they can take advantage of them" (Arkush, 9/3, <a href="https://www.dailyherald.com/sports/20180903/hub-arkush-dont-let-mack-hype-distract-from-rest-of-bears" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Daily Herald</em></a>)</p>
