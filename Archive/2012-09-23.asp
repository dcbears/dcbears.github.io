							<p><strong>Taking the Packers Loss Hard: </strong> "I just bought my husband, a lifelong Bears fan, a Chicago Bears plush robe for his anniversary gift, and guess what? After Thursday night's game, he said I should return it" (Letter to the Editor, 9/14, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/opinions/letters/15143759-474/bears-fan-is-fading.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Sun-Times</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Former Bear Alex Brown on Cutler:</strong> "I just don't think you can make a leader. You can't groom a leader. They have to want to be," Brown said. "You can't just jump on the wagon and say, 'I'm gonna do it my way, do it this way' when you're talking about a franchise. The whole franchise is not gonna change for you. There are certain things you don't say. Even if you really, really feel that way, you don't say that stuff out in the public. You just don't" (Wright, 9/18,  <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4678157/brown-bears-will-have-big-decision-on-cutler%20" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">ESPN</a>).</p>													<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong> "In his career, Cutler has played 33 regular-season games against teams that made the playoffs that year, according to STATS. His winning percentage in those games is .303 and his passer rating is 78.9" (Pompei, 9/18, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-0919-pompei-bears-chicago--20120919,0,3966505.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>						</div>
