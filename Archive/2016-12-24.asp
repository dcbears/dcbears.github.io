							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 3pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against the Redskins</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears trail the all-time series with the Redskins 25-23-1 and have lost six straight, their longest current skid against any team. The Bears lost the last meeting 24-21 on Dec. 13, 2015 at Soldier Field.</p>
							<p><strong>On Coach Fox:</strong> On the field, the Bears have looked inferior in a majority of their games under Fox. That was the case once more last Sunday in their loss to the Green Bay Packers. Fox's decisions at the end of the game were baffling. Overlooking the fact that Fox should have went for it on fourth down instead of kicking a game-tying field goal, the Bears' head coach was unprepared. At first, it had seemed that Fox was attempting to win the game and avoid overtime. Then, it appeared that Fox wanted overtime. Then, it looked as if Fox changed his mind once more and was trying to avoid overtime. How can any team be prepared if their head coach becomes an indecisive blob during games?
