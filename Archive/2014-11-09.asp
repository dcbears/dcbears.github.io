							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 7pt <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Packers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Coach Trestman's job on the line?:</strong> "Probably not&hellip;  Since Mike Ditka was fired after the 1992 season, the Bears have had four coaches in 21 seasons, including Trestman &mdash; despite making the playoffs just five times in that span. In fact, Abe Gibron is the only Bears coach to be fired in fewer than four seasons" (Potash, 11/3, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/30843156-606/10-observations-vs-packers-bears-bringing-sense-of-urgency.html#.VF0z-fnF9Zk" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Unparalleled Rivalry:</strong> "At the end of the day, the rivalry that has held up the best is Bears- Packers, stretching all the way back to its beginning in 1921. There was even a time when the two teams played each other not just twice but three times per season. Through 189 contests (including two playoff matchups), <strong>the scoring differential is a razor-thin 60 points</strong>, in favor of the Bears -- that averages out to about a third of a point per game. When I think of the greatness of this rivalry, I think of the trains that used to run between Green Bay and Chicago, ferrying supporters of the visiting team to each game -- and it was always a party going back, whether the fans on board were celebrating a win or a loss. This is the No. 1 rivalry today and of all time (Brandt, 11/7, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000424236/article/nfls-best-rivalry-bearspackers-remains-among-top-choices" title="External site opens in new window" class="external" target="_blank">NFL.com</a>)</p>
