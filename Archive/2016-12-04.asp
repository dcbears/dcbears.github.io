							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favored</a> by 1pt</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears trail the all-time series with the 49ers 32-30-1 but have won four of the last six. The Bears lost the last meeting 26-20 in overtime last Dec. 6 at Soldier Field.</p>
							<p><strong>On Sunday:</strong>  "The San Francisco 49ers versus the Chicago Bears. "The Spit Take By The Lake." "The Windy City Wind Break." "The Upchuck Yield At Soldier Field." Even trying to nickname this matchup is horrible. Add to it a weather forecast that includes "Bear weather" that will only push the game further into a comedy of errors, and it's going to be so awful. Get pumped" (Baffoe, 12/1, <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2016/12/01/baffoe-hey-bears-please-lose-to-the-49ers/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"> <em>CBS Sports</em></a></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong> "Eighteen times over the last two seasons, the Bears offense has taken over possession in the final 6 minutes of regulation or overtime with a chance to produce a game-tying or go-ahead score. Only four times have the Bears capitalized with scores. And on one of those &mdash; in Week 11 of 2015 &mdash; they failed to add a two-point conversion to tie the Denver Broncos" (Wiederer, 11/30, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-bears-blitz-struggling-in-clutch-spt-1201-20161130-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</p>
