							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">3pts favorites</a> against Detroit</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Playoff Scenario: </strong> Bears clinch a playoff spot with: 1) CHI win + MIN loss or tie OR 2) CHI tie + MIN loss <a href="http://www.nfl.com/playoffs/playoff-picture" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">NFL</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Must Win:</strong>  "If the Bears lose this game, however everything could change, from the coaching staff to the veterans in the locker room. No one will be safe" (Bowen, 12/26, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-spt-1227-bears-matt-bowen--20121227,0,6720186.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Are These Bears Any Good?: </strong> "After 15 games, we still don't know. After almost nine seasons with Smith, including more victories than any coach except George Halas and Mike Ditka, three division titles, two visits to the NFC Championship Game and one Super Bowl appearence, we still don't know at this late date if the inscrutable man with the calmness of tropical lagoon should be treasured or sent fishing" (Telander, 12/27, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/17253337-606/telander-bears-season-has-been-impossible-to-figure-out.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Sun-Times</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong>  Da Bears would become just the second team in the 23-year history of this playoff structure to miss out on the playoffs after a 7-1 start (Seifert, 12/24, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/51269/free-head-exam-chicago-bears-47" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>ESPN</em></a>)</strong></p>
