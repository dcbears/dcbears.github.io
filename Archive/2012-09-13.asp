							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 6pt <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Underdogs</a> Against Packers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Reality check?: </strong>"So after an impressive-looking victory over the Colts on Sunday, the Bears are looking good but have a lot to prove. A year ago they opened with an even more impressive victory over a playoff-caliber team in the Falcons, then crapped out on the road against the Saints. Coming off a 20-point win over the Colts, we’ll know they’re for real when they play even better against a much better team". (Potash, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/15063833-419/bears-still-have-much-to-prove-plus-10-observations.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>, 9/10).)</p>
							<p><strong>Not Cheap:</strong> "It will cost the average family of four $608.64 to attend a Bears game, including parking, food and souvenirs, in 2012, according to Chicago-based Team Marketing Report’s latest Fan Cost Index, which includes breakdowns for all NFL teams. That is more than a 16.3 percent increase over 2011, and the highest price increase among the 32 teams" (Lambert, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2012/09/10/ticket-cost-for-chicago-bears-fans-up.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Chicago Business Journal</a>, 9/10.</p>						</div>
