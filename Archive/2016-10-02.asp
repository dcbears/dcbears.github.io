							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 1pt <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Detroit</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears lead the all-time series 96-71-5 and the 96 wins are their most against any opponent. But their six straight losses are tied for the longest skid against the Lions since the series began in 1930.</p>
							<p><strong>Reason to Believe:</strong> "It's hard to believe the Bears will remain as sloppy and stagnant as they've been in the season's first month. These are not &mdash; we don't think &mdash; the 0-16 Lions of 2008, or even the 4-12 crews of Wannstedt's last two years in 1997 and '98. So some sort of breakthrough &mdash; and likely a win or two &mdash; seem imminent in the weeks ahead" (Wiederer, 9/29, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-bears-blitz-turnaround-possible-20160928-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Reason Not to Believe:</strong>  "If you look at the very core of the Bears problems, it's a lack of talent. They've been bungling drafts for as long as I can remember.  You know the best way to tell the Bears are missing on draft picks?  How many of their draft picks go on to sign big-ticket free agent contracts elsewhere?  It's rare that their homegrown guys go on to bigger things leaving the Bears. The Bears rarely get any supplemental draft picks because they're always bringing in more big money free agents than their castoffs" (Burzawa, 9/29,<a href="http://beargoggleson.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>BearGogglesOn.com</em></a>)</p>
