							<p><strong>Keep Calm and Carry On:</strong> "It's important not to push the panic button after one bad game. The Bears are still 3-1 and right in the thick of things if they maintain their composure and make the necessary adjustments. It will be an interesting Lions-Packers game next Sunday. I'm predicting that one of them will lose" (Warja, 9/29, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-bears-huddle/2013/09/chicago-bears-break-down-in-all-phases-of-the-game/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Chicago Bears Huddle</a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Thug Life:</strong> Lions vice chairman Bill Ford called the Bears a "<a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/22918320-606/lions-vice-chairman-bill-ford-calls-bears-a-bunch-of-thugs.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">bunch of thugs</a>" when asked about last week's game.</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong>  "Their remaining 11 opponents after the Saints have a composite record of 15-27. Things can change, but it's unlikely the second-half schedule will be as challenging as the one that doomed Lovie Smith last year - the Bears faced six eventual playoff teams in a row to start the second half and went 1-5. Of their second-half opponents this season, only the Lions (3-1) currently are above .500" (Potash, 9/30, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/22891994-606/10-observations-on-bears-loss-to-lions.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Sun-Times</a>)</p>
