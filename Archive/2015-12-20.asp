							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears trail the all-time series with the Vikings 56-51-2 but have won nine of the last13. The home team has won 22 of 27 meetings since 2002. Minnesota won the last meeting 23-20 in Chicago on Nov. 1.</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong> "Already, Cutler's 2015 season ranks in the top 10 in team history in completions and yards, while sitting at No. 16 overall in touchdowns. At his current pace, Cutler will finish in the top-10 in touchdowns, top five for yards and has a chance to finish with the most yards in team history. Had it not been for his injury, Cutler likely would have become the Bears' first quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards" (Thele, 12/15, <a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-football/7/71/1181633/jay-cutler-top-10-season-bears-history" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a></p>
