							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 5.5pt <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favorites</a> against Cardinals</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears lead the all-time series 58-28-6 and have won four of the last six matchups. These two founding franchises have the oldest series in the NFL, having first met in the league's first year of existence in 1920.</p>
							<p><strong>Chi-Ching:</strong> According to a new ranking by Forbes, the Bears are the seventh most valuable franchise in the NFL at $2.9 billion. The valuation represents a $50 million increase over last season. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/nfl-valuations/list/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Forbes</em></a>, 9/20).</p>
							<p><strong>In Defense of Mitch:</strong> "The main takeaway here is that a young quarterback's progression is not linear. You have to expect ups and downs along the way. Fans who don't take a more measured, and patient approach are setting themselves up for failure. After his first two seasons, there wasn't a single expert who didn't think Robert Griffin, III was a franchise quarterback. The same could have been said after Dak Prescott's rookie year" (Sheldon, 9/21, <a href="https://dawindycity.com/2018/09/21/chicago-bears-patience-mitch-trubisky/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">DaWindyCity.com</a>) 
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong> "Chicago has only trailed on the scoreboard for a grand total of two minutes and 13 seconds after two games" (Macmanaman, 9/20, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2018/09/20/cardinals-chicago-bears-defense/1371017002/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>AZCentral</em></a>)</p>
