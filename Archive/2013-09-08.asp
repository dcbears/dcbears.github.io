							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Welcome Back!</strong>: The <a title="External site opens in new window: The Union Pub" target="_blank" class="external" href="http://www.unionpubdc.com/">Union Pub</a> (UP) has been DC's gathering point for the area's Chicago Bears fans over the past seven seasons. They typically draw 150-200+ Bears fans for each game. Other Bears fans choose to take in the game at neighboring <a title="External site opens in new window: Bar 201" target="_blank" class="external" href="http://www.201bar.com/">Bar 201</a></p>
							
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in a new window">3pt favorites</a> against Bengals</strong></p>
							
							<p><strong>Monsters of the Middle?</strong>   "The 53-man roster general manager Phil Emery assembled includes enough talent for the Bears to win 11 games and qualify for the postseason. Or go 6-10 and take a quarterback in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft. The truth likely lies somewhere near the middle, in the land of 8-8, which guarantees wholly entertaining games one week followed by wildly disappointing duds the next" (Haugh, 9/1, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-01/sports/ct-spt-0902-haugh-bears-20130902_1_quarterback-cutler-jay-cutler-defensive-tackle-henry-melton" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>On Cutler:</strong> "As Bears fans, we like throwing Cutler in the elite quarterback conversation because quite frankly, we've never (ever) had a pretty darn good quarterback and that's who Cutler is. We've been used to mediocrity for so long that Cutler has been so much better than everything we've ever seen, we want him to be elite. He's elite in our eyes" (<a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/bearssth/2013/09/cutler-and-the-elite-label/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">4th Phase Blog</a>, 9/3)</p>
