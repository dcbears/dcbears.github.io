							<p><strong>On Trestman:</strong>   "Marc Trestman’s Bears weren’t exactly a revelation in their season-opening 24-21 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday at Soldier Field. The Bears came back to win games under Lovie Smith, too. They beat good teams. They took the ball away. They converted fourth-and-one plays. They scored from the 1-yard line. And they went an entire game without allowing a sack under Lovie. But rarely, if ever, did they do all that in the same game" (Potash, 9/10, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/22487852-606/trestmans-fine-debut-should-erase-doubts-about-lovies-loss.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Sun Times</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong> "Chicago has won 11 of 12 at home over Minnesota, averaged 35.6 points during this five-game winning streak and won the last three by an average margin of 20.3. The Bears have forced 31 turnovers in those 12 meetings, including 14 in the last five" (<a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/VikingsBears-Preview-54130464" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">FoxSports</a>, 9/11)</p>
