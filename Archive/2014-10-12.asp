							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 3pt <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against Falcons</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Ditka on Cutler:</strong> "When you look at Jay Cutler, would you say he's elite? Well, I don't know. What's elite? The kid I saw in Seattle last night [Russell Wilson], he's special. Peyton Manning, he's special. Drew Brees, Phillip Rivers, they're special. Is Jay in that category? I don't think so. He does a lot of things well, but the biggest thing he needs to do is get control of that offense. He needs to control it on the field and when things are going wrong, he needs to be the commander in chief. He needs to realize that if he leads, people will follow by example" (Ditka, 10/8, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/30323476-606/4-downs-with-mike-ditka.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, damn lies and statistics:</strong>  "The Chicago Bears have surrendered an average of 26.3 points per game, which is 23rd in the league.  They also rank 17th in total defense.  It's nothing to smile about" (<a href="http://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/more_chicago_bears_becoming_critical_of_mel_tucker/17455364" title="External site opens in new window" class="external" target="_blank">Yardbarker</a> 10/10)</p>
