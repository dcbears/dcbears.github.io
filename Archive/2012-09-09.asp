							<p><strong><em>Washington Post</em> Recognizes Bears Fans, Union Pub:</strong> "At the Union Pub, framed Mike Ditka and Brian Urlacher jerseys hang on the wall and fans drink Old Style beers and groove to the original "Super Bowl Shuffle." The kitchen serves Chicago-style pizza and hot dogs, and games are featured on 26 TVs, including a 100-inch projection screen on the heated patio. If you're a fan of the Bears -- and you know the words to "Bear Down Chicago Bears," which is blasted after touchdowns -- this is a place you'll want to be on Sundays" (Hahn, 8/31, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/best-bets/where-to-watch-college-and-nfl-football,81745.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Washington Post</a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Show Me the Money:</strong> The Chicago Bears are the eighth-most-valuable NFL franchise for the second straight year, with a total value of nearly $1.2 billion — nearly double its estimated worth nine years ago (Settimi, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/nfl-valuations/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Forbes</a>, 9/5)</p>
							<p><strong>Did You Know?:</strong> The McCaskey family spent $100 to purchase the Bears in 1920; which is just your standard 90-year, 11-million-percent return investment (Ecker, <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120905/BLOGS04/120909931/forbes-bears-valuation-has-nearly-doubled-in-9-years" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Crain's Chicago</a>, 9/5)</p>
