							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 7pt <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against the Ravens</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears lead the all-time series with the Ravens 3-2 and have won two of the last three. The Bears won the last meeting 23-20 in overtime on Nov. 17, 2013 at Soldier Field. </p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong> "I'm going to bet Pat O'Donnell is the only punter in the league that has the longest pass play for his team. That's what O'Donnell's toss to Benny Cunningham on the fake punt resulted in &mdash; a 38-yard gain that went for a touchdown" (Biggs, 10/10, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-mitch-trubisky-bears-vikings-10-thoughts-biggs-20171010-story.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Tribune</em></a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Going Forward: </strong> The Bears' remaining schedule is middle of the road &mdash; their opponents have a .500 win percentage currently &mdash; but they have a tough turnaround for Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens, plus good tests against the Carolina Panthers and improved New Orleans Saints prior to the Week 9 bye" (Edholm, 10/12, <a href="http://www.profootballweekly.com/lists/2017/10/12/66a62cff04cb44e4928aab36a6d4439a/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>ProFootballWeekly</em></a>)</p>
