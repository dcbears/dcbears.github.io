							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 3pt <a title="External site opens in new window" target="_blank" href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/nfl.aspx" class="external">Underdogs</a>... at Home.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>The Grass is Good?:</strong> "They've reassessed the field, and they feel that even after a couple of high school games and a college game last Saturday, that the surface at Soldier Field, with another week of maintenance every day, with the cooler weather, that it will be as good of a surface, as fast as you can have a grass surface be. ... It will be safe"  - Ted Phillips, Chicago Bears President (Seifert, 9/6, <em><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/30773/turfgames-bears-delay-soldier-field-re-sod" title="External site opens in new window" class="external" target="_blank" >ESPN.com</a></em>).</p>
							<p><strong>A Position of Ineptitude:</strong> Da Bears have had 18 different starting QB's during the course of Peyton Manning's 227 consecutive start streak.  See the list <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/7526182-419/hot-corner-bears-starters-since-1998.html" class="external" title="External site opens in new window" target="_blank" >here</a>.</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics:</strong> "The Bears were 7-3 in games decided by a touchdown or less, and that includes a mostly meaningless loss to the Packers in Week 17 . . . Since the strike season of 1982, there have been five other teams that were 7-3 in touchdown-or-less decisions in a given season. Those teams were 13-20 in those games the following year" (Barnwell, 9/2, <em><a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6918507/part-i" class="external" title="External site opens in new window" target="_blank" >Grantland.com</a></em>).</p>
							<p><strong>Roy Williams, Welcome:</strong> "Much suggests that Williams doesn’t deserve to start. But he will. That means he matters more than his recent production would warrant. He also carries more attention. It’s what happens with Halas Hall pets. See the the likes of Brandon Manumaleuna, Fred Miller, Orlando Pace and Adam Archuleta for details" (Rosenbloom, 9/8, <em><a class="external" title="External site opens in new window" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/rosenblog/chi-bears-roy-williams-sounds-like-he-doesnt-get-it-20110908,0,2211470.column" target="_blank" >Tribune</a></em>).</p>
