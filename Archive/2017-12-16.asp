							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 2.5pt <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against the Lions</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears lead the all-time series with the Lions 97-73-5 but have lost eight of the last nine. The Bears lost the last meeting 27-24 on Nov. 19 at Soldier Field</p>
							<p><strong>On Coach Fox:</strong>  "A win Saturday would help stem perhaps the most disturbing Fox trend: The Bears are 3-13 against the NFC North in his tenure, with one win apiece against the Packers, Lions and Vikings. They're 0-4 against the division this season with two division games left to play. As a result, they've been in last place in the division for 34 consecutive NFL weeks, and in sole possession of last place for 27 weeks and counting" (Finley, 12/14, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/john-foxs-struggles-vs-nfc-north-one-reason-bears-went-south/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
