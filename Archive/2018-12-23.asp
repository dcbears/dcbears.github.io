							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> San Francisco 49ers lead the series 34-31-1. The 49ers won their last meeting, 15-14, last season in Chicago.</p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favored</a> by 4 pts against the 49ers </strong></p>
							<p><strong>On Mack:</strong> "It's also worth mentioning that his 12.5 sacks are the second most Mack has ever had in a season, and it is also more than double the amount of sacks as anybody else on the Bears squad. Mind you, that is with Mack missing two games for the first time in his career this year due to injury. The guy has only played in three games that he didn't get at least one sack in this year, and the two and a half he got on Sunday were the most he's in one game all season" (White, <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/12/20/18146114/chicago-bears-khalil-mack-butt-sack-unblockable-packers-aaron-rodgers" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>SBNation</em></a>, 12/20)</p>

							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics: </strong> The Bears are the only team to hold a second-half lead in every game this season, and Chicago leads the league in fewest first-half points allowed (84). The Bears have held opponents to six or fewer halftime points in eight games this year, most in the league... Chicago is first in the NFL with 35 takeaways and first in the NFL with a +13 turnover margin. The last time the Bears led the league in turnover margin was 1985..."
