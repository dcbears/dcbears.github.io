							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 3pt <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/lines" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favorites</a> against the Seahawks</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Seahawks have won three straight in this series, and five of the last seven dating back to 2007.</p>
							<p><strong>Its Been Awhile:</strong> "The Bears have won the most home openers of any NFL team (65), but they've dropped four straight to the Bills (23-20 in overtime in 2014), Packers (31-23 in 2015), Eagles (29-14 in 2016) and Falcons (23-17 in 2017)" (Mayer, 9/12, <a href="https://www.chicagobears.com/news/wednesday-weigh-in-bears-prepping-for-seahawks" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">ChicagoBears.com</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Mack Attack:</strong>  "Khalil Mack had a sack, an interception, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and scored in the first two quarters. The last player to do that in the NFL? That would be Mack in Week 12 of the 2016 season" (Richey, 9/11, <a href="http://www.news-gazette.com/sports/illini-sports/football/2018-09-11/three-reasons-hope-lives-bears-2018-season.html" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>News-Gazette</em></a>) 
							<p><strong>Why Watch:</strong> "For only the second game of the season, this one sure feels big. Monday night marks the first real opportunity to see how new head coach Matt Nagy and this young Bears team reacts to adversity. Do they let a brutal loss to the Packers set the tone for the season, or do they come out throwing hay-makers?"
