							<p><strong>Football in London:</strong> "I don't know how popular the NFL is in England or anywhere else in the United Kingdom. I know how popular the NFL says it is -- roughly as popular as The Beatles, tea and ignoring modern dentistry combined -- but the image pushed by the NFL PR machine may differ slightly from reality. This year's game at Wembley is not sold out" (9/20, <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/The-British-would-like-their-own-NFL-team?urn=nfl-wp10018" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">YahooSports</a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Roy Williams on playing in London:</strong> "It's a long way to play a football game, but we'll play anywhere. We'll play on cement, Antarctica &#8230; wherever we're scheduled to play is where we have to play. And we'll be ready to play." (Mitchell, 9/20, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1021-bits-bears-chicago--20111021,0,7666329.story" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Bears DT Anthony Adams and <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/8291016-606/bears-anthony-adams-leaves-fans-atwitter-as-he-models-skinny-jeans.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Skinny Jeans</a></strong></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong> Robbie Gould ranks third in Bears career scoring with 739 points (172 field goals, 223 extra points) and is just 12 points shy of surpassing Payton for second place on the list. Former kicker Kevin Butler is the franchise’s all-time leading scorer with 1,116 points (Mitchell, 9/19, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-gould-set-to-surpass-payton-on-bears-career-scoring-list-20111019,0,5701305.story" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
