							<p><strong>Bears <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Favored</a> by 5.5pts Against Jaguars</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Managing Expectations:</strong> "With the victory over Dallas, Chicago wraps up its first quarter in impressive fashion: 3-1 overall, a game in front of the rival Packers, tied atop the division with the Vikings. This is wonderful no matter which way you slice it, but it hardly feels cathartic. We expected the Bears to be good, their record shows they are good, but it's still not enough. When 3-1 doesn't do it, is it a problem with the team or a problem with the fans?" (O'Donnell, 10/2, <a href="http://chicago.sbnation.com/chicago-bears/2012/10/2/3442330/bears-vs-cowboys-highlights-tony-romo-jay-cutler" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">SBNation</a>)</p>
							<p><strong>Defense Wins Ball Games: </strong> "this defense knows that while Cutler carries the franchise quarterback title, he has not been the star of the team. The 3-1 record has little to do with Cutler, and everything to do with the 11 guys on the field while Cutler is shoulder bumping his linemen or walking away from his OC. A league-high 14 turnovers through the first four games, as well as 15 sacks and three defensive touchdowns is Exhibit A, B and C in making that case" (Cowley, 10/2, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/15524541-606/superstar-bears-defense-doesnt-concern-itself-with-cutler.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
