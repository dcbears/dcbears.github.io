							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">3pt</a> Underdogs</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Keep Calm and Carry On...:</strong> Not only should Chicago feel comfortable heading into Week 14 with an 8-4 record, but they have to like their chances of at least earning a Wild Card spot thanks to a favorable schedule over the final four weeks of the regular season. The Bears most difficult matchup will take place on December 16 when they take on the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field and the other three remaining teams (Minnesota Vikings, Arizona Cardinals and Detroit Lions) they’re scheduled to play don’t have winning records" (Parzych, 12/5,  <a href="http://www.rantsports.com/videos/2012/12/05/rant-my-life-fans-need-to-relax-over-chicago-bears-falling-short-of-playoffs-due-to-brian-urlachers-injury/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">RantSports</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Or Not...:</strong> The Bears are in second place in the NFC North (the Packers have the tiebreaker), and I can’t remember a time when an 8-4 record felt so fragile. I can’t remember a defense looking so old so fast. All those turnovers for touchdowns earlier in the season look like a masking agent" (Morrissey, 12/5, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/16834640-419/morrissey-urlacher-smith-likely-to-return-its-the-bears-way.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics:</strong> "Five times in the final 11 games in '09, when the Bears last played without Urlacher, the defense surrendered 30 points or more" (Biggs, 12/5, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1206-bears-chicago--20121206,0,7293858.story" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics II:</strong> "The only pity is the Bears defense has logged an entire game more in terms of snaps when compared to their offense. The defense has 759 snaps compared to the offense which has accumulated only 700. Typically, each side logs 60 to 70 snaps during a game" (Miller, 12/5, <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/football-chicago-bears/bears-talk/Miller-No-pity-party-for-banged-up-Bears?blockID=810243&feedID=7139&utm_source=Master+List&utm_campaign=e4a6feb612-Daily+CSNChicago.com+E-Blast&utm_medium=email" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>CSNChicago</em></a>).</p>
