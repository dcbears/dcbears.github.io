							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 4pt <a href="http://sportsdirect.usatoday.com/odds/usatoday/odds.aspx" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">favorites</a> against Titans</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Putting the Carolina victory in perspective:</strong>  "Surviving the 1-6 Panthers thanks to a last-second 41-yard Robbie Gould field goal represented a good win more than a bad sign for the Bears. Skeptics will remain unconvinced until the Bears beat a playoff-caliber team such as the Texans or 49ers but, in the NFL, apologies need not accompany victories of any kind" (Haugh,10/28, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1029-bears-haugh--20121029,0,6195937.column"title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Believe!:</strong> "So, let the bandwagon start now. T-shirts bearing (pun intended) the slogan “Hibernation is my Forte” for one and all. It is time to get excited" (Reddoch, 10/29, <a href="http://www.craveonline.com/sports/articles/198851-the-bears-are-for-real-folks" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Craveonline</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Understanding Cutler:</strong>  "What's not to like? Well, there’s Cutler’s demeanor. He comes across as bored and indifferent on his best days, smug and condescending on his worst. He simply doesn’t care what you or I or anybody else outside the Bears’ locker room thinks of him and won’t cooperate with a city that wants to love him" (McGrath, 10/27, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/15970392-606/jay-cutler-can-learn-a-thing-or-two-from-kerry-wood.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em> Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics:</strong>  "Since 2004, the Bears have now scored 24 touchdowns on INT returns, which is good for third in the NFL over the past eight years.The Bears are now 19-5 over the past seven years when they score a touchdown on defense. Since 2004, the Bears have scored 31 defensive touchdowns (24 INT returns, and seven fumble return TDs)" (Wright, 10/28, <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/bears/tag/_/name/2012-week-8-coverage" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>ESPN</em></a>).</p>
