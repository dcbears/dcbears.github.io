							<p><strong>Happy B-Day Ditka: </strong> Da Coach turned 73 on Thursday. I couldn't think a better way to celebrate Ditka than to share this <a href="http://beargoggleson.com/2012/10/18/happy-birthday-coach-ditka/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">"best of"</a> clip from his days as Chicago Bears head coach (BearGoggles.com <a href="http://beargoggleson.com/" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">BearGoggles.com</a>, 10/18)</p>
							<p><strong>The Lions Rivalry?: </strong>  "The rivalry between Bears fans and Packers fans is more fun than fierce. Chicagoans own most of Wisconsin, and America's Dairylanders know it. It's our nuclear argument-ender. But the Lions are a different story" (Morrissey, 11/19, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/15832889-606/lions-are-the-bears-real-rivals.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Did You Know?:</strong> Phil Simms and Cutler are the only two quarterbacks in the last 35 years to be drafted in the first round despite never having a winning season in college (Potash, 11/16, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/football/bears/15795541-606/bears-release-chris-williams-re-sign-zack-bowman.html" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>McCaskey Family Values: </strong> Owners of the Chicago Bears hosted religious leaders and politicians Sunday at the team's practice facility in Lake Forest, where speakers lamented the "eroding freedom to speak in the language of faith in the public square." (Smith, 10/15, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-15/news/ct-met-bears-religious-freedom-20121015_1_contraception-mandate-chicago-bears-gay-marriage" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Tribune</em></a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics: </strong>  Cutler is 5-1 as a Bears starter against the Lions and has a career 105.0 passer rating against them in seven starts overall. It's his best passer rating against any opponent with a minimum of four starts, just ahead of the 100.8 he has posted against the Vikings (Biggs,10/19, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1019-cutler-bears-chicago--20121019,0,1150669.story" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>).</p>
