							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 6pt <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">favorites</a> against the Packers</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> Green Bay's 35-14 win over the Bears Sept. 28 at Lambeau Field gave the Packers the lead in the all-time series between the longtime rivals for the first time since 1933. The Bears led 81-56 after the first matchup in 1992, but the Packers have won 39 of 52 meetings since that point to take a 95-94-4 edge. </p>
							<p><strong>On Sunday:</strong> "Soldier Field figures to be a raucous place Sunday, with fans seeing green and gold, and smelling blood. They won't care a bit that Rodgers is out with a broken collarbone. The presumption in all the enthusiasm is that Trubisky is better right now than Hundley is, because who the hell is Hundley? He's a 2015 fifth-round pick who has thrown one touchdown pass and four interceptions since taking over for Rodgers. He did complete 26 of 38 passes for 245 yards in a loss to the Lions on Monday night. Never mind that, so far, Trubisky's stats are similarly unremarkable" (Morrisey, 11/8, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/bears-packers-mitch-trubisky-aaron-rodgers-john-fox-brett-hundley/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Sun-Times</em></a>)</p>
