							<p><strong>McNabb a Bear?: </strong>  "Even with a diminished skill set, McNabb provides a safer, smarter alternative than McCown. No NFL team poses much of a postseason threat using its No. 3 quarterback, but at least McNabb would give the Bears some semblance of a pro-style offense" (12/2, Haugh, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/ct-spt-1202-haugh-bears-chicago--20111202,0,1908343.column" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Tribune</a>).</p>
							<p><strong>Jay Cutler on his engagement to Kristin Cavallari:</strong> "You guys probably know as well as I do, I don't really make a lot of those decisions. I'm kind of just along for the ride. ... I hear about them in passing or if I have to possibly write a check or something of that sort. Other than that, whatever she wants to do, I'm on board" (12/1, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5864363/jay-cutler-on-his-engagement-round-two-i-dont-really-make-a-lot-of-those-decisions" title="External site opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Deadspin</a>).</p>
