							<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Bears are 7pt <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/odds/" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window">underdogs</a> against the Bengals</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Series History:</strong> The Bears trail the all-time series with the Bengals 6-4 and have lost two of the last three matchups. The Bears won the last meeting 24-21 on Sept. 8, 2013 at Soldier Field.</p>
							<p><strong>On Trubisky:</strong>  "If you're keeping track at home, the Bears are last in total yards, passing yards and first downs, and they're 30th (out of 32) in scoring and 28th in third-down efficiency. In the four games since the bye, the Bears have had only 2 runs and 6 receptions longer than 20 yards. On 17 of his last 20 carries, Pro Bowl running back Jordan Howard has gained 3 yards or less" (LeGere, 12/6, <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/sports/20171206/why-the-bears-offense-has-been-a-dud-this-season" target="_blank" class="external" title="External site opens in new window"><em>Daily-Herald</em></a></p>
